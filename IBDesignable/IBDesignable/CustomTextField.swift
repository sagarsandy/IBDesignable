    // After defining the desired properties in the above method, we just need to change the class of the respoective textfield to "CustomTextField(whatever the class name is)" in the interface builder.
    // Once u define the class in the interface builder, just need to build the project once, then the storyboard file show the updated changes.
    // Remember we need to import @IBDesignable in this class.
